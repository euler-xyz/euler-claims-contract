This release constitutes an express and voluntary binding waiver and relinquishment to the fullest extent permitted by law.  If I am acting for or on behalf of a company (or other such separate entity), by clicking "I agree to the terms to claim redemption" on the euler.finance web interface or executing the EulerClaims smart contract and accepting the redemption and agreement, I confirm that I am duly authorised to enter into this contract on its behalf.

To the extent that the terms of this release are inconsistent with any previous agreement and/or Euler’s terms of use, I accept that these terms take priority and, where necessary, replace the previous terms.
